# This is my profile
###### My name is Hussein Talaat.
 I am an Electronic Engineer.
 I like Timon and Pumba cartoons, as well as Pinguin of Madagascar, that's why I'll include their picture in my profile.

 I am learning coding so, I am trying to include this code in github:
 
 ```
$ git init
Initialized empty Git repository in /Users/skills/Projects/recipe-repository/.git/
```
Also, I am practising to add list to my file as below;

- [x] List syntax is required
- [x] This item is complete
- [ ] This item is not complete
